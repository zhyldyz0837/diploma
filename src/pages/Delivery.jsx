The "Quick Order" feature allows the buyer not to go through the entire ordering process on their own. You fill out the form, and in a short time the store manager will call you back. He will clarify all the conditions of the order, answer questions regarding the quality of the product, its features. It will also tell you about payment and delivery options.


Based on the results of the call, the user either, having received clarifications, independently places an order, completing it with the necessary items, or agrees to place an order in the form in which it is now. Receives confirmation by email and waits for delivery.
